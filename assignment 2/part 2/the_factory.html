<h2 id="what-is-a-factory">What is a factory?</h2>
<p>A factory is a design pattern that deals with the creation of
objects. It was invented to decrease the amount of coupling between
classes. Coupling is what can happen if a complex object is being
interfaced with directly. This can cause many threads of interaction to
form between the controlling and the controlled object. Which in turn
leads to difficultly maintainable code.</p>

<em>A nice representation of coupling, in my opinion</em></p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-factory-solve-this-issue">How does a factory solve
this issue?</h2>
<p>A factory aims to solve coupling by abstracting away the
instantiation of objects in a new and separate factory class. In which
the processing computations named <strong>products</strong> are
handled.</p>
<p>Imagine you could program cooking. One could create a class named
<code>Chef</code> and <code>Chef</code> is able to do many things. He
could, for example <code>cook</code>, <code>clean</code>,
<code>use_oven</code>, <code>yell_at_cook</code> and
<code>smoke_cigarette</code> as any chef typically does. The Chef is
proficient at interacting with many objects in the kitchen. Think of
<code>Knife</code>, <code>Oven</code>, <code>Whisk</code>,
<code>Cigarettes</code> but also <code>Courgette</code>,
<code>Truffle</code>, <code>Egg</code>, <code>Caviar</code>,
<code>Milk</code>, <code>Flour</code>.</p>
<h3 id="one-day">One day</h3>
<p>On a good day, Monsieur Toddler walks into the restaurant and orders
pancakes. Chef is dumbfounded, his restaurant is a place of
sophistication and refine. Alas, the customer is king, and chef gets to
work even though his kitchen isn’t exactly made to cook pancakes.
However, his kitchen is made to cook, and the chef is flexible, he just
needs to give orders to the cooks! Chef grabs the great book <em>Cuisine
a la Usine</em>. A fine book that contains explicit instructions of how
to use the kitchen in combination with the ingredients to produce
pancakes. He puts his cooks to work, and in a whirl, the finest pancakes
are served, which are devoured by Monsieur Toddler. Chef hangs his apron
on a hook and leaves home, vowing never to cook pancakes in his kitchen
ever again.</p>
<h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3>
<p>In this story, Chef isn’t bound by the things that were served on the
menu. He just needed to update a new product in the cooking factory.
This was done easily, and was reverted just as easily. This is what
factories do.</p>

id="does-implementing-a-factory-follow-the-interface-segregation-principle-isp">Does
implementing a factory follow the <em>Interface Segregation Principle?
(ISP)</em></h2>
<p>Implementing a factory method <strong>can</strong> follow the ISP
depending on how the factory is written.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes, if the factory method is implemented in such a way that the
interface is specific.</p></li>
<li><p>No, if the factory method interface is large and includes methods
that a client does not need or use. This would violate the ISP because
clients would be forced to implement unnecessary methods. This would
defeat the use of a factory all again, just adding unnecessary
complexity.</p></li>
</ul>
